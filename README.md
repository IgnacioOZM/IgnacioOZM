About myself,

I recently completed my internship in Business Intelligence in the EMEA GES DATA Team in Luxembourg (12th August). 
And I recently graduated with my double master's degree in Industrial Engineering and Smart Industry at ICAI.

During my master's degrees, I had the opportunity to practice with C/C++ and Python language for multiple purposes/projects
such as data analysis with machine learning algorithms for classification, regression, and forecasting. Self-guide 
robots for localization, mapping, and path estimation. And computer vision algorithms for industrial Pick&Place 
applications based on object detection, convolutional regression, and a synthetic image dataset generator.

During my internship I further developed my skills in writing SQL queries, scheduled ETL jobs (data feed, transform/load job), 
developing python pipelines hosted in AWS lambda to extract data, and creating reports from tools such as SIM and Asana.
And as part of my internship project, I aided the DEs from DATA Team with the migration of multiple services to AWS
(Migration of DB, establishing the permissions and connections of AWS Glue and migrating SSIS jobs to Glue, connection 
of a redshift cluster with Hootâ€¦)

Currently I am looking for a job position as a SDE that will help improve my coding skills and will chalenge my creativity
and problem solving skills.
